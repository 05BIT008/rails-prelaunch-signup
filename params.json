It's not difficult to build such an app in Rails.\r\n\r\nBut why build it yourself if others have already done so? This project aims to:\r\n\r\n* eliminate effort spent building an application that meets a common need;\r\n* offer code that is already implemented and tested by a large community;\r\n* provide a well-thought-out app containing most of the features you'll need.\r\n\r\nBy using code from this project, you'll be able to:\r\n\r\n* direct your attention to the design and product offer for your prelaunch site;\r\n* get started faster building the ultimate application for your business.","tagline":"An example Rails 3.2 app for a web startup prelaunch site.","google":"UA-5109366-14","note":"Don't delete this file!
